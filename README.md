## Loyalty Program 

The general trend has been positive for loyalty members at Elist. The proportion of yearly sales and orders from loyalty members as well as the loyalty member AOV grew steadily through 2021 and exceeded that of non-loyalty members in 2021 as well. Loyalty order count exceeded non-loyalty members in January of 2021, while loyalty sales and AOV exceeded that of non-loyalty members in April and June, respectively. 

- For all products except the iPhone, the average yearly AOV has been greater for loyalty members than for non-loyalty members. The Apple iPhone is the only product that has never been purchased by a loyalty member. 
- The Macbook Air took the longest for us to see any orders placed by loyalty members - only in May of 2021 did loyalty members start to purchase this product. This may be contributing to the increase in sales and AOV in 2021.

The overall refund rate is 6%, with the highest refund rate occurring in 2020 at 10% and the lowest refund rate occurring in 2022 at 0%. There may be a missing data issue because there were zero refunds from August 2021 onwards.

- The highest refund rates occurred in May of 2020 at 12%, and March 2021 at 11%, while the lowest rate occurred in June of 2021 at 4%. 
- The product with the highest refund rate is the Thinkpad laptop, at 12%, followed by the Macbook Air Laptop at 11%. The products with the lowest refund rates is the Samsung charging cable (1%) and the Bose headphones (0%).
- The aov of loyalty member refunds ($297) is significantly lower than the aov of non-loyalty member refunds ($549), but the refund rate for loyalty members (6%) is higher than that of non-loyalty members (4%).


# Recommendations 

- Consider phasing out the four products that have brought less than 5% of total sales, and concentrate on offering more computers and potentially more in-ear headphones like the apple airpods.
- Given that samsung charging cable brings in a lot of orders but has low AOV, try to capitalize on this customer base by offering more expensive Samsung products.
- Increase marketing efforts for expensive products in APAC because of high AOV.
- The highest and lowest AOV of all time occurred back to back in Fall of 2022 - consider further examination of this short-term volatility.
- continue the loyalty program, potentially offer perks for the loyalty program for those who purchase the Apple iPhone.
