Over 90% of sales and orders are coming from NA, EMEA, and APAC. More than half of the sales and orders come from North America itself. APAC has the second to lowest % of sales and orders, but it has the overall highest AOV.

### Product Breakdown:
Over 95% of total sales come from four products: the 4k Gaming Monitor, Apple Airpods, Macbook Air, and Thinkpad Laptop. Over 90% of the total orders comes from the 4k Gaming Monitor, Apple Airpods, and Samsung Charging Cable. The Samsung Charging Cable Pack brings in less then 2% of total sales, but over 20% of the total order count. The Apple iPhone and the Bose Headphones both bring in less than 1% of both sales and orders.

## Loyalty Program Performance 

On the whole, about 60% of sales and orders are coming from non-loyalty customers, and loyalty members are spending less per order. 

However, the adoption of the program has steadily increased yearly: 
- In 2021, the percentage of sales and orders from loyalty members became larger than that of non-loyalty members
- In 2022, loyalty AOV became greater than non-loyalty AOV

Loyalty program adoption and performance across products:
- Across all products except the iPhone, loyalty members are spending more than non-loyalty members. The lack of any loyalty members spending on the Apple iPhone is causing overall AOV to be lower for loyalty members.
- Samsung Webcam, Bose Headphones, and Apple Airpods (three of the four lowest price products) have had more orders placed by loyalty members than non-loyalty members.
